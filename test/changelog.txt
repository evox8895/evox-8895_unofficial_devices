You ask me if I love you, it's automatic
Because every time you leave me, I die, that's automatic too
You ask me to forgive you, when you know, I'm just an addict
So stop the music baby, You know, You're all I want to do
Hey

A-U-T-O-matic, just tell me what to do
A-U-T-O-matic, I'm so in love with you
